                    Luzon may also refer to one of the three primary island groups 
                    in the country. As such, it includes the Luzon mainland, 
                    the Batanes and Babuyan groups of islands to the north, Polillo Islands 
                    to the east, and the outlying islands of Catanduanes, Marinduque and Mindoro, 
                    among others, to the south. The islands of Masbate, Palawan and Romblon 
                    are also included, although these three are sometimes grouped with the Visayas.</p>

                    The Visayas (/vɪˈsaɪəz/ vi-SY-əz), or the Visayan Islands (Cebuano: Kabisay-an, 
                    locally [kabiˈsajʔan]; Tagalog: Kabisayaan [kabiˈsɐjaʔan]), are one of the three 
                    principal geographical divisions of the Philippines, along with Luzon and Mindanao. 
                    Located in the central part of the archipelago, it consists of several islands, 
                    primarily surrounding the Visayan Sea, although the Visayas are also considered 
                    the northeast extremity of the entire Sulu Sea. Its inhabitants are predominantly 
                    the Visayan peoples.</p>
                <p class="description">
                    The major islands of the Visayas are Panay, Negros, Cebu, Bohol, Leyte and Samar.                     
                    The region may also include the provinces of Palawan, Romblon, and Masbate whose 
                    populations identify as Visayan and whose languages are more closely related to 
                    other Visayan languages than to the major languages of Luzon.</p>

                    Mindanao (/mɪndəˈnaʊ/ (About this soundlisten)), also commonly known as the 
                    Southern Philippines, is the second-largest island in the Philippines, 
                    after Luzon. Mindanao and the smaller islands surrounding it make up the 
                    island group of the same name. Located in the southern region of the archipelago, 
                    as of the 2010 census, the main island was inhabited by 20,281,545 people, 
                    while the entire Mindanao island group had an estimated population 
                    of 25,537,691 (2018).</p>

                  The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, 
                  a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus). 
                  Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, 
                  with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018.[1] up from more than 
                  19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world 
                  than any other bird or domesticated fowl.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily 
                  as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, 
                  less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or 
                  for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until 
                  the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[3][4]

                  <br><br>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in 
                  South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but with the clade found 
                  in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in 
                  the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the domesticated chicken 
                  spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 
                  5th century BC.[6] Fowl had been known in Egypt since the 
                  mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" 
                  having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, 
                  Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.

                  <br><br>In the UK and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year 
                  are primarily known as cocks, whereas in the United States, Canada, 
                  Australia and New Zealand, they are more commonly called roosters. 
                  Males less than a year old are cockerels.[10] Castrated or neutered 
                  roosters are called capons (surgical and chemical castration are now 
                  illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year old are 
                  known as hens, and younger females as pullets,[11] although in the 
                  egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, 
                  at 16 to 20 weeks of age. The young are called chicks. In Australia and 
                  New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term 
                  chook /tʃʊk/ to describe all ages and both sexes.[12]

                  <br><br>Chicken originally referred to young domestic fowl.[13] 
                  The species as a whole was then called domestic fowl, or just fowl. 
                  This use of chicken survives in the phrase Hen and Chickens, sometimes 
                  used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of 
                  one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example 
                  Hen and Chicken Islands). The hen and chickens was also a name for the 
                  pentacycle, an early design of cargo cycle which had a large central 
                  driving wheel surrounded by four small stabiliser wheels.
                  
                  <br><br>In the Deep South of the United States, chickens are referred to 
                  by the slang term yardbird.
